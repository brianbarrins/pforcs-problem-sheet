#Weekly Tasks
#7. Write a program called extract-url.py, that will extract the URLs from an access.log file.
#ie The part of the URL that is stored in the access.log file, complete with the query parameters (I am aware that the host name is not stored in this file, the referring host is)
#The program should store the URLs as strings in a list.
