# WEEK2 BMI
# Purpose:
This program allows any user to input their height and weight and then displays their BMI and gives them an indication as to what this means

# Comments:
The user input is stored in two separate variables, which are then computed against eachother to calculate the BMI
I added a separate if elseif statement to create classifications for a BMI in the ranges
The classification is done by comparing the output versus predefined values

# Week 3 BitCoin Price
# Purpose:
This program allows any user to determine the current price for Bitcoin in the three major Western world currencies

# Comments:
When looking at the json file and the printout in the terminal, it was very hard to see what the structure was visually
I opened the data in Notepad++ and formatted it better there and saw the structure of the file with the different indentations

Using the bpi as the highest level, I can now pick each of the sub categories and their attributes individually
Using the rawest form of the float data: rate_float as the output avoids any potential issues with the comma in the normal rate. This would be for potential future proofing/parsing of data
