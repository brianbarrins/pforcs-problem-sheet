#Weekly Tasks
#1. Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI).
# The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
# The output  is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

#create variables for height and weight and BMI
#use of float to allow for decimals and computations
height = float(input("Please enter your height in Metres: "))
weight = float(input("Please enter your weight in Kilograms: "))
#formula = weight * height squared (using**2 in lieu of height * height)
bmi = weight/(height**2)

#classifications
    #underweight: <18
    #healthy: 18-25
    #overweight: 25-29
    #obese: 30-39
    #extremelyobese: 40+

#simple if and else if statements based on mathematical float value for bmi
