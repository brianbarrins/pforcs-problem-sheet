#Weekly Tasks
#5. Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
#You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
#I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x)
#I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots
